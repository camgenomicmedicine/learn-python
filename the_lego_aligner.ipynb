        "The Smith-Waterman algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm used for local sequence alignment. It is designed to find the best local alignments between two sequences by assigning scores to matches, mismatches, and gaps. The algorithm creates a scoring matrix that computes the optimal alignment scores for each position in the sequences, and then traces back from the highest score in the matrix to find the optimal local alignment.\n",
        "\n",

        "The Smith-Waterman algorithm is specifically designed for local alignment, whereas the algorithm used in our example is more focused on a global alignment approach. It aligns the entire read to the reference genome without considering gaps or allowing for partial alignments.\n",

        "The Smith-Waterman algorithm uses dynamic programming to build a scoring matrix and performs a traceback procedure to identify the optimal alignment. In contrast, our algorithm uses a simpler sliding window approach to find the best matching position in the reference genome, and it doesn't involve building a scoring matrix or performing traceback."
